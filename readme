# Module3 Smart Contract

Module1 is a simple Ethereum smart contract built using Solidity. It extends the OpenZeppelin ERC20 and Ownable contracts to create a custom ERC20 token with some additional features.

## Features

- Custom ERC20 token named "Berwyn" with the symbol "BWN".
- Minting new tokens can only be done by the contract owner.
- Burning tokens allows the contract owner to decrease their own balance.
- Transferring tokens includes additional logic through the `transfer` function to track the transaction.
